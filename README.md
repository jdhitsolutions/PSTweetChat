# PSTweetChat Archive

<img src=assets/talkbubble.png align='left' alt='chat bubble'> This repository contains transcripts that I created for the monthly `#PSTweetChat` on Twitter. On the first Friday of every month, members of the PowerShell community got together on Twitter. We shared experiences, tips, tricks, and words of encouragement. I created transcripts of the chats by tracking the `#PSTweetChat` tag. You can find monthly transcripts in the [Transcripts](/transcripts) folder. Previous years are in archive folders by year.

Unfortunately, either due to Twitter's changes allowing access to their API or a change in the Google Sheets plug-in I had been using, I can no longer track the `#PSTweetChat` hashtag and thus cannot generate the transcript files. We will continue to hold the monthly chats on Twitter, but there will no longer be a monthly transcript.
